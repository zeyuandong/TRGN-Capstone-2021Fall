1.   Title:
Differential Gene Expression of African American with Prostate Cancer
2.   Mentor:
Enrique I. Velazquez-Villarreal  eivelazq@usc.edu
3.   Proposed Written Portion：

  (I) Traditional thesis, turned in as a PDF consisting of no-less than six pages written with 0.5" margins, Ariel 11 or Times New Roman 12, with sections of  Introduction, Methods, results, and discussion.

  In the introduction, I'll talk a bit about what is Prostate Cancer? What is RNA-seq? What is looking for Rna-Seq?

  In Methods, I will introduce Data information (Source) and detail the Workflow of each step, such as Data were obtained through HPC (CARE2 Bioinformatics, Statistical & Methodological Shared Resources BSMSR CORE). FASTQ to BAM to VCF; STAR (RNAseq); Samtools; Mutation analysis; Data were analyzed by DESeq2; Add regression formula.

  As a result, I will Relax p-values and find a different set of genes that are significant.

  In the discussion, I will find genes related to prostate cancer; Cell Network of PCS.

  （II）I build Capstone's repository on Github and update my code. I will also generate Rmarkdown to clearly describe each step that is being done and what is observed.
